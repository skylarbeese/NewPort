                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>Everyone uses email to communicate and send information. Many people 
                    still use it as their primary means of communication. This project 
                    will consist of designing a new email site that is visually sleek 
                    and modern in its design as well as making it easier to use and find the necessary tools.
                </p>

                    <h1>My Role</h1>
                    <p>I conducted user research to learn the user's habits and 
                        better understand their needs. I then created a persona based 
                        on my findings and also conducted a competitive analysis of 
                        different email platforms. I took note of what 
                        works and what does not on the different sites and implement that in my design. 
                        After that, I will take my findings and design a new UI for an email platform.

                         I needed to get to know the users 
                            and their main needs for the platform. That also included getting to know 
                            their habits and uses for their email. Most users tend to check their email 
                            multiple times a day. They receive and send all kinds of mail from different 
                            sources either personal, professional for their work or school and 
                            other sources. Some of the tools that they use most are finding their sent
                             mail, and mail marked as important.

                                       After getting more information about the target demographic I was able to create user personas based
                                        on my findings.
                                    </p>

                                    After the research on the users is done I started to take a look at the current 
                                    webpage and began the first stages of the redesign. The sitemap helped view 
                                    the content, flow of the pages, and the information that is laid out on each page.
                                </p>

                                    After the site mapping is finished I start to layout the information 
                                    on the pages creating wireframes to give us the beginning stages of 
                                    what the finished site will look like.

                                     will most likely be looking at it on their phones. I wanted 
                                     to make sure the website will work for mobile devices as well. 
                                </p>

                                    The color and images are incorporated after the final 
                                    wireframes are created. The finished mockups will be 
                                    what the new rendition of the site will look like. 
                                    I wanted to ultimately make the information on the 
                                    site easier for people to understand, and make the 
                                    most important features that people would need for 
                                    applying to the program be more prominent which will

                                    The final stage of the redesigned website was to create and 
                                    test the prototype of the new layout. I tested 3 different 
                                    areas of the site to make sure future students would be able 
                                    to find them. The 5 test users were high school to college age. 
                                    They were asked to complete a handful of tasks on the website
                                    which included finding the advising and scholarships pages. 
                                    They also were asked to find more information about the major itself. 
                                    Our testing concluded I still had some redesigning and 
                                    adjustments to make with some of the pages. Users were 
                                    having a hard time finding the advising page. They were 
                                    trying to find the advisers through the faculty and staff 
                                    page. We fixed this problem by adding a link to the advising 
                                    page on the faculty and staff page.

                                    Throughout this project, I worked closely with a stakeholder to get to know her
                                    goals for the website and the most important objectives to accomplish with the 
                                    new layout of the website. I learned about the needs of the audience regarding there 
                                    concerns for the job market and how to highlight that on the webpage. This has been one of
                                    the largest websites I have worked on and it was a huge learning experience to work on something
                                    of this scope.
