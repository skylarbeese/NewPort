            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>Everyone uses email to communicate and send information. Many people 
                still use it as their primary means of communication. This project 
                will consist of designing a new email site that is visually sleek 
                and modern in its design as well as making it easier to use and find the necessary tools.
            </p>

                    <h1>My Role</h1>
                    <p>I conducted user research to learn the user's habits and 
                        better understand their needs. I then created a persona based 
                        on my findings and also conducted a competitive analysis of 
                        different email platforms. I took note of what 
                        works and what does not on the different sites and implement that in my design. 
                        After that, I will take my findings and design a new UI for an email platform.

                                    <p>I felt that it was important to research other 
                                        email sites to get a feel of how they work. I wanted to take note of the aspects that I thought
                                         worked and those that did not. Many of them had the same 
                                         fundamental layout. The search bar is at the top right, the 
                                         toolbar on the left side. I wanted to keep the same general 
                                         layout so that it would make it easier for new users coming 
                                         over from other websites to use this new layout. I also found
                                          that the UI for that website did not look modern and felt that it 
                                          could be updated.

                                <p>
                       
                                    From the research, I found that most of the email platforms had the same basic 
                                    layout. I wanted to use this so when I started wireframing for the new website 
                                    I kept the same basic layout and most of the aspects of the site, search bar, 
                                    slide-out menu bar, mail lists in the same places. I also wanted to create a 
                                    more modern look and feel to the new design. I laid out the most important 
                                    aspects first on the menu. I wanted the compose button to be prominent and
                                     able to be seen even when the menu was closed.

                                <h1>Solution</h1>
                                <p> The original need was to create a new email page that was easier to use were the most important aspects were prominent and could be found easily. 
                                    All this needed to be done well to give the new email platform a more
                                     modern look and feel that other sites out there did not have. This is the final 
                                     mockup of the website and what the finished design will look like.

                                <h2>Prototyping and User Testing</h2>
                                <p>
                                  The prototype was created in Abode XD. For the final testing, I had 
                                  my users go through a handful of tasks to ensure that the design and 
                                  functionality of the site would be the best possible. Using the 
                                  previous user persona created I ask the testers to complete the 
                                  following tasks and assess how they performed. The first is 
                                  to compose a new message and send it. Another was asking 
                                  them now to find the mail they save as important. I finished 
                                  by getting their feedback on the design. 
          
                                </p>
                             
                            </div>
                            <div class="img-con">

                                        It was easy to navigate the site and the users were able to complete 
                                        the first assessment rather easily. However, the wording on the menu 
                                        to find the saved and important messages were confusing to the users.

                                    I believe that this application has a lot of great potential for users.
                                    I would like to continue refining the app to make it more user friendly
                                    and dive deeper into how it can solve users' problems.
