                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>
                    This is a redesign of Nike's store website. I choose a few different pages and
                    features of the website to try to improve upon and make it easier for the user navigating
                    the website. I started by doing user research to get an idea of how users shop on the
                    internet and learn what features are important for them when looking for items to purchase
                    online. I continued the research by comparing similar websites and brands' UI laid out
                    on their website. After the research and analysis, I started to experiment with the visual design of the
                    site with sketches and wireframes. Once I had decided how I wanted the new features and layout of the
                    webpages to look I created the final design and prototyping of the webpage.

                    <p> 
                        I was the main designer on this project and carried out the research, design and user testing.

                                Certain features and pages on the website needed to be redesigned so that the
                                user could better navigate the website and have a better online shopping experience.
                                Through my research, I learned about some of the habits of online shoppers and what
                                frustrations they have during their internet shopping experience.

                                        The Nike website needed to be easier for users to find particular merchandise.
                                        I wanted the homepage to show more product options and allow for easier access to
                                        men's and women's clothing and subcategories of them both, in addition, the men's and
                                        women's pages needed to show the merchandise and their categories first. Previously they did not.
                                        One of the last things that needed to be improved was the way the filter system for searching through
                                        the products was designed. I knew I could make it easier to use.

                                    habits. I started the research by interviewing people who frequent shopped online. I asked them
                                    to go through their normal processes well shopping online, how frequently they went online to shop,
                                    and some of the most important features of a website that they used frequently.

                                        I also wanted to conduct a Competitive analysis of online websites selling 
                                        similar products. I choose to research and compare the Adidas, Converse, and
                                        Reebok webpages to see how they were laid out and what their features were.
                                        Based on the user research I conducted earlier on, I wanted to see if these websites
                                        had certain features that were important to the users, one of them being having
                                        clear access to different clothing sections from the home page. I wanted to see if
                                        and how these different features were implemented in the UI of the websites.

                                        After I finished gathering my research I created a user persona, based on the analysis of
                                      the information I collected. This will help in determining what users will need to get out of the

                                    After my research and analysis, I started on the redesign of the UI for Nike's
                                    webpage. I used the user persona that I created to form my analysis of my research
                                    as well as what I learned from my Competitive analysis to start planning the new
                                    UI for the website.
                                </p>

                                    to the UI.     
                                </p>

                                    <p>
                                        One of the most challenging aspects of the new design was figuring out how
                                        to improve the filter feature of the item's search pages. I wanted to make it
                                        faster and easier for the user to find the categories for the items they might
                                        want to filter by. I also wanted the user to be able to see the categories they
                                        were filtering by even when the dropdown menu was closed. I also wanted them to
                                        have the ability to click out of each option if they wanted with the menu closed as well.  
                                    </p>
                                
                                </div>
                                <div class="heading-text"></div>

                                <div class="img-con img-bk">
                                    <div class="heading-img heading-img-be" style="background-image: url(img/BeforeAfter.png);"></div> 
                                    </div>

                                            I needed to have the men's and women's pages show the merchandise they were selling first
                                            so that it would be easier for the user to find.   
                                        </p>
                                    
                                    </div>

                                    <div class="heading-img" style="background-image: url(img/BeforeAfterMens.png);"></div>

                                    The final stage of the redesigned website was to create and 
                                    test the prototype of the new layout. I tested 3 different 
                                    areas of the site to make sure future students would be able 
                                    to find them. The 5 test users were high school to college age. 
                                    They were asked to complete a handful of tasks on the website
                                    which included finding the advising and scholarships pages. 
                                    They also were asked to find more information about the major itself. 
                                    Our testing concluded I still had some redesigning and 
                                    adjustments to make with some of the pages. Users were 
                                    having a hard time finding the advising page. They were 
                                    trying to find the advisers through the faculty and staff 
                                    page. I fixed this problem by adding a link to the advising 
                                    page on the faculty and staff page.

                                    Throughout this project, I was able to learn more about the needs of my users. I would like to
                                    continue on with this project doing prototyping and then user testing to continue to improve
                                    upon the redesign of this webpage.
