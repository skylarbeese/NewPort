                                Utah Valley University's annual student showcase is taking place in the coming 
                                spring semester. The department wants the event advertised so that students
                                 will be aware of the date of the event and will want to attend. I will be 
                                 designing digital signage to put up on the screens around the school.

                            <p>I will be carrying out the design process from initial rough sketches 
                                to the final design and animation of the screens in Adobe XD.

                                The UVU SCULPT event needs more people to be aware of the upcoming event and attend. 
                                They need a way to advertise the student showcase. In this first screen I will be 
                                creating digital signage that will showcase the time and date of the event. 
                            </p>

                     <h1>The Design</h1>
                     <p>
                        I started out the design process by creating wireframes of what I 
                        thought the final design should be. I needed to have a large image 
                        background and a way for the most important text to get the viewers 
                        attention. I made the most important information, the time and date 
                        of the event larger and of a brighter color so it would stand out 
                        from the background making it more prominent from the rest.

                    <div class="show-wire" style="background-image: url(img/signWire2.png);"></div>
                    <div class="show-wire" style="background-image: url(img/signWire4.png);"></div>

                        <h1>Prototyping and Next Steps</h1>
                        <p>
                            After the final design of the poster was completed I needed to animate the background 
                            so that the poster would slide through each image and the theme heading text as a slideshow. 
                            This was initially done in Adobe XD to demonstrate what the animation would look like 
                            when it was completed. The next steps of the project would be to take it into software 
                            like Adobe After Effects and create the final product. Posters informing the students 
                            on how to sign up and submit work for the event, as well as who has won and will be 
                            presenting at the showcase will also need to be created as time goes on.
