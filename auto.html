                <p>


                    This project is to redesign the Automation and Electrical Engineering site for Utah Valley University's 
                    website. The Automation and electrical technology program needs to reach out to more potential students. 
                    Most people do not know about the program and if they do learn about major it is through word of mouth. 
                    The Automation and electrical technology program needs a better webpage to get more attention through 
                    there online presents. The overall goal is to get more people informed about the program through the 
                    UVU website. There needs to be more students signing up for the program. 
                </p>

                    <li>The project must be finished on Dec 16, 2021</li>
                    <li>the new website must work within the layout of UVUs content Management System</li>
                    <li>  The new design must be consistent with the rest of the UVU website</li>

                <h1>My Role</h1>
                <p> On this project, I will be working in a group with 5 others. The work will be divided 
                    and we will all be performing pieces of the research and design phase. I Researched current students and people considering attending the University to get a better understanding
                    of what aspects of the job market are most important to them so we will know what things should be
                    highlighted when redesigning the site as well as their court knowledge of the engineering program is And
                    if they would be interested in enrolling. I also redesigned 3 of the new pages that will be incorporated into the new layout.

                        <p>       The main concern of the stakeholder was to get more people aware of the program primarily 
                            the AAS degree because there were so few people applying to the program each year. The goal was 
                            to get more students to enter the program. Research needed to be conducted to see what people 
                            know about the program and who might be interested in it. We needed to understand what was most 
                            important to people regarding the job market.

                           the courses. The students will also need a page where they can connect with an adviser and see the other

                                        <p>The final stages of the redesigned website was to create and test 
                                            the prototype of the new layout. We tested 3 different areas of 
                                            the site to make sure future students and potential students 
                                            would be able to fine so of the more important areas of the site. 
                                            The 5 test users were high school to college aged. They were as 
                                            to do a handful of tasked on the website. Which included finding 
                                            the advising and scholarships pages as well as finding more 
                                            information about the major itself. Our testing concluded that 
                                            we still had some redesigning and adjustments to make with some 
                                            of the pages. Users where having a hard time finding the advising page. 
                                            They where trying to find the advisers through the faculty and staff page. 
                                            We fixed this problem by adding a link to the advising page on the faculty
                                             and staff page.
