                <h1>A Breif Overview</h1>
                <p>This project it to redesign the Automation and Electrical Engineering site for Utah Valley Universitys website.
                    First we meet with the programs deprtment head to get an understanging of what they would like for the new
                    webpage as will as the goals that they would need meet for the program. We then began by doing research in a number of
                    areas to get a feel for who we are most likily is going to be intrested in the program and how to better
                    engage with the users. After there research phase is over we start to create new layout ideas for the webpages. When the
                    final mockups of the site are complete we prototype and test the newly redesign site.

                <p> On this project I will be working in a group with of 5 others. The work will be devided 
                    and we will all be proforming peices of the research and design phase. I Conducted research 
                    on current students and people considering attending the University to get a better understanding
                    of what aspects of the job market are most importent to them so we will know what things should be
                    highlited when redesigning the site as well as there cournt knologe of the engineering program is And
                    if they would be intrested in enrolling. I also redesigned 3 of the new pages that will be incorporated into the new layout.

                       using the website. We tested 5 partisapents and asked them to naviaget the site doing tasks that real
