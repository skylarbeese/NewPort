                <p>
                    This project is to redesign the Automation and Electrical Engineering site for 
                    Utah Valley University's website. The Automation and electrical technology 
                    program needs to reach out to more potential students. Most people do not 
                    know about the program and if they do learn about the major it is through 
                    word of mouth. The Automation and electrical technology program needs a 
                    better web page to get more attention through their online presents. The 
                    overall goal is to get more people informed about the program through the 
                    UVU website. There needs to be more students signing up for the program.  
                </p>
                <h2>Constraints</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>The project must be finished on Dec 16, 2021</li>
                    <li>the new website must work within the layout of UVUs content Management System</li>
                    <li>  The new design must be consistent with the rest of the UVU website</li>
                </ul>

                <h1>My Role</h1>
                <p> 
                    On this project, I will be working in a group with 5 others. The work will be 
                    divided and we will all be performing pieces of the research and design phase. 
                    I researched current students and people considering attending the University 
                    to get a better understanding of what aspects of the job market are most 
                    important to them. So we will know what things should be highlighted when 
                    redesigning the site and what might interest people in applying for the program. 
                    As well as asking about their current knowledge of the engineering program. 
                    Also seeing if they might be interested in enrolling in the program. I will 
                    also redesign 3 of the new pages that will be incorporated into the new layout.

            <h1>Challenges and Goals</h1>
                        <p>There is currently a lack of knowledge of the program in the university. 
                            We need to make more people aware of the AET program and also encourage 
                            people to join while online.

            <h1>Research and user interviews</h1>
                        <p> 
                            The main concern of the department was to get more people aware of the 
                            program, primarily the AAS degree because there were so few people 
                            applying to the program each year. The goal was to get more students 
                            to enter the program. Research needed to be conducted to see what 
                            people know about the program and who might be interested in it. 
                            We needed to understand what was most important to people regarding 
                            the job market. So we would know how to promote the program on the 
                            website. We ended up surveying students on what time of jobs they 
                            may be interested in and how important things like salary and job 
                            security were to them. We ended up finding that security was a lot 
                            more important than their income. These are things that we could 
                            use to promote the program because the is a 100% job placement 
                            rate for grads.

                            After the research on the users is done we started taking a look at the current 
                            webpage and began the first stages of the redesign. The sitemap will help view 
                            the content, flow of the pages and the information that is laid out on each page.

                            Several pages must be included in the final website layout. 
                            The first is a home page. This page will be the landing spot 
                            for the user and should contain important information about 
                            the program that we will want to highlight for the user. 
                            The next is an about page. This page should contain the 
                            mission statement of the program and other key information. 
                            The Degrees and programs page needs to have information about 
                            the courses. The students will also need a page where they 
                            can connect with an adviser and see the other faculty members 
                            and professors in the program.

                            After the site mapping is finished we start to layout the information 
                            on the pages creating wireframes to give us the beginning stages of 
                            what the finished site will look like.

                                            The final stages of the redesigned website is creating and 
                                            testing the prototype of the new layout. We tested 3 different 
                                            areas of the site to make sure future students would be able 
                                            to find them.The 5 test users were high school to college aged. 
                                            They were asked to complete a handful of tasks on the website. 
                                            Which included finding the advising and scholarships pages. 
                                            As well as finding more information about the major itself. 
                                            Our testing concluded we still had some redesigning and 
                                            adjustments to make with some of the pages. Users were 
                                            having a hard time finding the advising page. They were 
                                            trying to find the advisers through the faculty and staff 
                                            page. We fixed this problem by adding a link to the advising 
                                            page on the faculty and staff page.

                        local photographer. For this project, I will need to create a page 
                        to display the body of work a few other things that are important to
                        be incorporated into the site, like a form to contact the photographer. I 
                        will also be experimenting with possible logo designs, should the client want
                        to use them.
