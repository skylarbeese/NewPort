                    <h1>Overview</h1>
                    <p>Everyone uses email to communicate and send information. Many people 
                        still use it as their primary means of communication. This project 
                        will consist of designing a new email site that is visually sleek 
                        and modern in its design as well as making it easier to use and find the necessary tools.

                        <h1>My Role</h1>
                        <p>I conducted user research to learn the user's habits and 
                            better understand their needs. I then created a persona based 
                            on my findings and also conducted a competitive analysis of 
                            different email platforms. I took note of what 
                            works and what does not on the different sites and implement that in my design. 
                            After that, I will take my findings and design a new UI for an email platform.

                        <p>
                         I needed to get to know the users 
                            and their main needs for the platform. That also included getting to know 
                            their habits and uses for their email. Most users tend to check their email 
                            multiple times a day. They receive and send all kinds of mail from different 
                            sources either personal, professional for their work or school and 
                            other sources. Some of the tools that they use most are finding their sent
                             mail, and mail marked as important.

                        <h2>Competitive analysis</h2>
                    <p>After this, I also felt that it was important to research other 
                        email sites out there to get a feel of how they work and how they are
                        designed. I wanted to take note of the aspects that I thought
                         worked and those that did not. Many of them had the same 
                         fundamental layout. The search bar is at the top right, the 
                         toolbar on the left side. I wanted to keep the same general 
                         layout so that it would make it easier for new users coming 
                         over from other websites to use this new layout. I also found
                          that the UI for that website did not look modern and felt that it 
                          could be updated.

                            allowed target users to be identified and their main needs and habits 
                            to be addressed.

                        From the research, I found that most of the email platforms had the same basic 
                        layout. I wanted to use this so when I started wireframing for the new website 
                        I kept the same basic layout and most of the aspects of the site, search bar, 
                        slide-out menu bar, mail lists in the same places. I also wanted to create a 
                        more modern look and feel to the new design. I laid out the most important 
                        aspects first on the menu. I wanted the compose button to be prominent and
                         able to be seen even when the menu was closed.

                        <p> The original need was to create a new email page that was easier to use were the most important aspects were prominent and could be found easily. 
                            All this needed to be done well to give the new email platform a more
                             modern look and feel that other sites out there did not have. This is the final 
                             mockup of the website and what the finished design will look like.

                                The prototype was created in Abode XD. For the final testing, I had 
                                my users go through a handful of tasks to ensure that the design and 
                                functionality of the site would be the best possible. Using the 
                                previous user persona created I ask the testers to complete the 
                                following tasks and assess how they performed. The first is 
                                to compose a new message and send it. Another was asking 
                                them now to find the mail they save as important. I finished 
                                by getting their feedback on the design. 
        
                              </p>

                                It was easy to navigate the site and the users were able to complete 
                                the first assessment rather easily. However, the wording on the menu 
                                to find the saved and important messages were confusing to the users.
