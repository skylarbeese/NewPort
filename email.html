                    <p>Everyone uses email to communicate and send information. Many people 
                        still use it as their primary means of communication. This project 
                        will consist of designing a new email site that is visually sleek 
                        and modern in its design as well as making it easier to use and find the necessary tools.

                            better understand their needs. I will be creating a persona based 
                            on my findings. I will also be looking at several different 
                            platforms and reviewing their designs. I will be taking note of what 
                            works and what does not and implement that in my design. 
                            I will be taking the information that I have gathered to the 
                            design process as I start to construct wireframes and later final mockups.

                        platform quickly and efficiently to get their tasks completed in a timely 
                        manner by sending information and communicating to whoever they need to.

                            Having the goal of the project in mind we need to get to know the users 
                            and their main needs for the platform. That will also include getting to know 
                            their habits and uses for their email. Most users tend to check their email 
                            multiple times a day. They receive and send all kinds of mail from different 
                            sources either personal, professional for their work or school and 
                            other sources. Some of the tools that they use most are finding their sent
                             mail, and mail marked as important.

                        <h2>Checking out the competition</h2>
                    <p>After this I also felt that it was important to research other 
                        email sites out there to get a feel of how they work and there 
                        designed. I wanted to take note of the aspects that I thought
                         worked and those that did not. Many of them had the same 
                         fundamental lay out. The search bar at the top right, the 
                         tool bar at the left side. I wanted to keep the same general 
                         layout so that it would make it easier for new users coming 
                         over from other websites to use this new layout. I also found
                          that the UI for that website did not look modern and felt that it 
                          could be updated.

                        From the research I found that most of the email platforms had the same basic 
                        layout. I wanted to use this so when I started wireframing for the new website 
                        I kept the same basic layout and most of the aspects of the site, searchbar, 
                        slide out menu bar, mail lists in the same places. I also wanted to create a 
                        more modern look and feel to the new design. I layed out the most important 
                        aspects first on the menu. I wanted the compose button to be prominent and
                         able to be seen even when the menu was closed.

                        <h1>Solution</h1>
                        <p>The original need was to create a new email page that was easier to use where the most important aspects were prominent and could be found easily. 
                             All this needed to be done well to give the new email platform a more
                              modern look and feel that other sites out there did not have. This is the final 
                              mockup of the website and what the finished design will look like.

                                    The feedback from the user test can go into reviewing the final site. Revisions
                                     may need to be done to ensure the design will create the best experience for the user as possible.

                                The prototype was created in Abode XD. For the final testing I had 
                                my users go through a handful of tasks to ensure that the design and 
                                functionality of the site would be the best possible. Using the 
                                previous user persona created I ask the testers to complete the 
                                following tasks and assess how they performed. The first being 
                                to compose a new message and send it. Another was asking 
                                them now to find the mail they save as important. I finished 
                                by getting their feedback on the design. 
        
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               
                               It was easy to navigate the site and the users were able to complete 
                               the first assessment rather easily. However the wording on the menu 
                               to find the saved and important messages was confusing to the testers.
