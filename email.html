                    <h1>A Breif Overview</h1>
                    <p>Everyone uses an email platform to communicate and send each other 
                        information whether that is for personal or professional use. 
                        Students as well as businesses use if as a primary means of 
                        communication and passing of information.

                        <h1>My Role</h1>
                        <p>I will be taking a look at similar sites and ideatifying some of the problems that they have for the users. I will be wireframeing and creating high fidilty mockups of the new site. As well as 
                            prototyping the new email platform.

                    <h1>The main problem and goal</h1>
                    <p> It is important for a user to be able to find their messages 
                        quickly and easily,saving important mail as well as sending 
                        their own emails to people. Many of the current email 
                        platforms contain tools that the average user doesn't 
                        need when all they need to do is see their messages and 
                        send outgoing mail to businesses, school and personal 
                        acquaintances. This project will consist of designing an 
                        email homepage that has the most important tools and 
                        information where people can access easily and do away
                         with some of the visual clutter.

                            Now that the problem has been identified and the requirements of the project have 
                            been laid out more research needs to be conducted on the target users. Most users need to
                            use there email site to send enformation for personal, professional or educational purposes.
                            they check there email multiple times a day. There are many websites and programs that will 
                            send automatic mail and it is importent to be able to filter through and find what is most importent
                            quickly.

                        <h2>Checking out the competition</h2>
                    <p>I reviewed several diffrent email platforms that consiste of the following below to get a feel for there layout anf design. Most of them had basics of the say layout. Meny of them had a side bar that
                        contained the buttons and tools that could be used. A top searchbar as well as the
                        home button. Many of these fetures should be included and placed relitivly in the same places so that it will be eaisy for users to transer across platforms well creating visual simplicity and updating design
                        to adhear to the modern feel and standerds.

                        <p>User personas were constructed based on the findings. This will 
                            allow target users to be indentified and their main needs and habits seen.

                        After the research is done and the user needs have been identified as well as stating the main aspects of the site that need to be incorporated and updated from other sights that have been investigated the visual design now needs to be explored.
Wireframes were created to iterate through the initial stages of the design. Exploring where and how the information will be laid out of the design of this new webpage. The design was carried out through both mobile and desktop layouts

                        As stated above some important things that needed to be addressed in the site was the need for updating the look to be sleek and modern. On my exploration through similar sites many of the components were laid out similarly, and I believed that it was important to keep a familiar design throughout the new pages. Because it will be easier for new users to transfer over across platforms.

                        <p>We started out needing to create a new design for an email platform that was sampled for the average user. Updating the visual design to be more modern and more familiar to what users see on newer websites. Making it easier for them to view their email and send mail, putting the most used features in easy to find places.
