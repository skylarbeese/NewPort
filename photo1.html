            <h1>Overview</h1>
            <p>A local freelance photographer and videographer wanted to get more
                traffic to their business and have a place to show their work online. 
                They needed a website to serve as their place to show and brand their work,
                 and their business, as well as provide a way for clients to contact 
                 them. This project consisted of designing a functional web page 
                 for a small business that meets the needs of the client. I 
                 also designed a logo that they might use on their website, business cards, and 
                 products that they might like to sell in the future.</p>
            
                
                </div>
              
                <div class="heading-text">
                    <h1>My Role</h1>
                    <p>I was the sole designer and developer on this project. I will start 
                        by designing a logo for the client. Next, I designed the UI for their 
                        website. I created low-fi wireframes and final mockups of the 
                        UI of their website, as well as prototyped and developed the website. 
                    </p>

                        <h2>Goals</h2>
                        <p>Previously my client had been using social media to promote their work.
                            However, this is not ideal because not everyone uses the same social 
                            media platforms. They needed a webpage to direct clients to so that everyone 
                            will be able to see their work.  
                            The overall goal was to be able to promote their business to everyone 
                            and display their work to the public. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The client needed a place on the internet to showcase their body of work to potential clients.</p>
                         <p>  There also needed to be a place on the site that will allow people to contact them.
                        </p>
                        <p>  The website should have links to their social media.
                        </p>

                                    <h1>Branding and Logo Design</h1>
                                    <p>One of the requirements was to design a logo that the client could use for the website, business
                                        cards, or any other needs that the client might have. I experimented with some possible logo designs that might be used.
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                                <p>
                                    lo-fi wireframes were created to explore possibilities 
                                    for the layout of the site. Users need to be able to view their work and contact 
                                     the photographer through 
                                     the website. Another important
                                       detail was to add links to their social media 
                                       sites so people could get to their businesses' 
                                       Facebook and Instagram accounts. 
                                </p>

                                <h1>Final UI</h1>
                        <p>The Gallery page was one of the most important aspects of the site. 
                            I wanted the visual layout of the site to be pleasing to look at
                             and allow the user to click on and view the images close up 
                             as well as on a grid. 
                        </p>
                            
                            </div>

                                    <p>I designed a contact form for the user to get in touch with the photographer and book
                                        appointments. 
                                    </p>

                                <p>
                                    I was able to design a functional UI to give a photographer work 
                                    and their business a home on the internet and allow them to grow past 
                                    solely using social media platforms to showcase their work. This will 
                                    allow the client to get more people's attention as well as have a 
                                    more professional feel to their work and business.

                                    I had a lot of fun working on this website. I go to explore designing
                                    different visual layouts. In the future I'd like to build more on this 
                                    website, designing an eCommerce feature to sell artwork.
