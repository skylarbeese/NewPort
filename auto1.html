                <h1>Overview</h1>
                <p>
                    This is a redesign of the Automation and Electrical Engineering website for 
                    Utah Valley University's website. The Automation and Electrical Technology 
                    program need to reach out to more potential students. Most people do not 
                    know about the program and if they do learn about the major it is through 
                    word of mouth. The Automation and Electrical Technology program need a 
                    better web page to get more attention through their online presence. The 
                    overall goal is to get more people informed about the program through the 
                    UVU website. There need to be more students signing up for the program.  
                </p>

                    <p> 
                        
                        I researched current Utah Valley University students and people that were considering 
                        attending to get a better understanding of what aspects of the job market are most 
                        important to them. The goal was to know what things should be highlighted when 
                        redesigning the site and what might interest people in applying for the program 
                        as well as asking about their current knowledge of the engineering program and
                        seeing if they might be interested in enrolling in the program. I will 
                        also redesign 3 of the new pages that will be incorporated into the new layout.

                                    The main concern of the department was to get more people aware of the 
                                    program, primarily the AAS degree because there were so few people 
                                    applying to the program each year. The goal is to get more students 
                                    to enter the program. Research needed to be conducted to see what 
                                    people know about the program and who might be interested in it. 
                                    I needed to understand what was most important to people regarding 
                                    the job market so we would know how to promote the program on the 
                                    website. I ended up surveying students on what type of jobs they 
                                    may be interested in and how important things like salary and job 
                                    security were to them. In conclusion, I found that security was a lot 
                                    more important than their income. These are things that I could 
                                    use to promote the program on the website since the degree has a 100%
                                    job placement.
                                </p>

                                       After getting more information about the target demographic I was able to create user personas based
                                        on my findings.
                                    </p>

                                <p>
                                    After the research on the users is done I started to take a look at the current 
                                    webpage and began the first stages of the redesign. The sitemap helped view 
                                    the content, flow of the pages, and the information that is laid out on each page.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                    After the site mapping is finished I start to layout the information 
                                    on the pages creating wireframes to give us the beginning stages of 
                                    what the finished site will look like.
                                </p>

                                     will most likely be looking at it on their phones. I wanted 
                                     to make sure the website will work for mobile devices as well.

                                    The color and images are incorporated after the final 
                                    wireframes are created. The finished mockups will be 
                                    what the new rendition of the site will look like. 
                                    I wanted to ultimately make the information on the 
                                    site easier for people to understand, and make the 
                                    most important features that people would need for 
                                    applying to the program be more prominent which will 
                                    entice more people to enter the program.

                                    The final stage of the redesigned website was to create and 
                                    test the prototype of the new layout. I tested 3 different 
                                    areas of the site to make sure future students would be able 
                                    to find them. The 5 test users were high school to college age. 
                                    They were asked to complete a handful of tasks on the website
                                    which included finding the advising and scholarships pages. 
                                    They also were asked to find more information about the major itself. 
                                    Our testing concluded I still had some redesigning and 
                                    adjustments to make with some of the pages. Users were 
                                    having a hard time finding the advising page. They were 
                                    trying to find the advisers through the faculty and staff 
                                    page. We fixed this problem by adding a link to the advising 
                                    page on the faculty and staff page.

                                    Throughout this project, I worked closely with a stakeholder to get to know her
                                    goals for the website and the most important objectives to accomplish with the 
                                    new layout of the website. I learned about the needs of the audience regarding there 
                                    concerns for the job market and how to highlight that on the webpage. This has been one of
                                    the largest websites I have worked on and it was a huge learning experience to work on something
                                    of this scope.

                    I researched current Utah Valley University students and people that were considering 
                    attending to get a better understanding of what aspects of the job market are most 
                    important to them. The goal was to know what things should be highlighted when 
                    redesigning the site and what might interest people in applying for the program 
                    as well as asking about their current knowledge of the engineering program and
                    seeing if they might be interested in enrolling in the program. I will 
                    also redesign 3 of the new pages that will be incorporated into the new layout.

                        <p> 
                            The main concern of the department was to get more people aware of the 
                            program, primarily the AAS degree because there were so few people 
                            applying to the program each year. The goal is to get more students 
                            to enter the program. Research needed to be conducted to see what 
                            people know about the program and who might be interested in it. 
                            I needed to understand what was most important to people regarding 
                            the job market so we would know how to promote the program on the 
                            website. I ended up surveying students on what type of jobs they 
                            may be interested in and how important things like salary and job 
                            security were to them. In conclusion, I found that security was a lot 
                            more important than their income. These are things that I could 
                            use to promote the program on the website since the degree has a 100%
                            job placement.

                            After the research on the users is done I started to take a look at the current 
                            webpage and began the first stages of the redesign. The sitemap helped view 
                            the content, flow of the pages, and the information that is laid out on each page.

                            Several pages had to be included in the final website layout. 
                            The first is a home page. This page will be the landing spot 
                            for the user and should contain important information about 
                            the program that we will want to highlight for the user. 
                            The next is an about page. This page should contain the 
                            mission statement of the program and other key information. 
                            The Degrees and Programs page needs to have information about 
                            the courses. The students will also need a page where they 
                            can connect with an adviser and see the other faculty members 
                            and professors in the program.

                                            to find them. The 5 test users were high school to college age. 
                                            They were asked to complete a handful of tasks on the website
                                            which included finding the advising and scholarships pages. 
                                            They also were asked to find more information about the major itself.
