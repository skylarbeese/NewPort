                    <h1>A Brief Overview</h1>
                    <p>A local freelance photographer and videographer wanted to get more
                        traffic to their business and have a place to show their work online. 
                        They needed a website to serve as their place to show and brand their work,
                         and their business, as well as provide a way for clients to contact 
                         them. This project consisted of designing a functional web page 
                         for a small business that meets the needs of the client. I 
                         also designed a logo that they might use on their website, business cards, and 
                         products that they might like to sell in the future.</p>

                    <h1>My Role</h1>
                    <p>I was the sole designer and developer on this project. I will start 
                        by designing a logo for the client. Next, I designed the UI for their 
                        website. I created low-fi wireframes and final mockups of the 
                        UI of their website, as well as prototyped and developed the website.

                        <h1>Goals</h1>
                        <p>Previously my client had been using social media to promote their work.
                            However, this is not ideal because not everyone uses the same social 
                            media platforms. They needed a webpage to direct clients to so that everyone 
                            will be able to see their work.  
                            The overall goal was to be able to promote their business to everyone 
                            and display their work to the public. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The client needed a place on the internet to showcase their body of work to potential clients.</p>
                         <p>  There also needed to be a place on the site that will allow people to contact them.
                        </p>
                        <p>  The website should have links to their social media.

                            <p>One of the requirements was to design a logo that the client could use for the website, business
                                cards, or any other needs that the client might have. I experimented with some possible logo designs that might be used.

                    <p>
                        lo-fi wireframes were created to explore possibilities 
                        for the layout of the site. Users need to be able to view their work and contact 
                         the photographer through 
                         the website. Another important
                           detail was to add links to their social media 
                           sites so people could get to their businesses' 
                           Facebook and Instagram accounts.

                            I wanted the visual layout of the site to be pleasing to look at

                            <h1>logo design and color scheme</h1>
                            <p>After deciding on the layout of the webpage I want to pick a color scheme that
                                can be used for the website. I choose to go with a handful of neutral colors that
                                could be used for the site. I also to some time to experiment with some possible 
                                logo designs if my client would like to use them.
                            </p>

                            <h1>Final Mockup</h1>
                            <p>I later created the final UI for the website using the images, text and color chooses.
                               I planned the image gallery layout with the images as seen in the final UI before hand.
                               I wanted the gallery page design to look seemless and the images to all be diffrent sizes.
                               this is what thet final layout of the webaite will look like. the last step now is to prototype
                               the artboards in a prototyping software, in this case I will be using Abode XD.
