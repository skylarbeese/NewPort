                    <h1>A Brief Overview</h1>
                    <p>A local freelance photographer and videographer wants to get more
                         traffic to their business and have a place to show their work online. 
                         They need a website to serve as their place to show and brand their work,
                          and their business, as well as provide a way for clients to contact 
                          them. This project will consist of designing a functional web page 
                          for a small business that meets the needs of the client. I will 
                          also be designing a logo that they might use on their website, 
                          products that they might like to sell in the future as well as
                           on business cards.</p>

                    <h1>My Role</h1>
                    <p>I will be the solo designer and developer on this project. I will start 
                        by designing a logo for the client. Next I will design the UI for their 
                        website. I will be creating low-fi wireframes and final mockups of the 
                        UI of their website, as well as prototyping and developing the website 
                        later on.

                        <h1>Goals</h1>
                        <p>Previously my client has been using social media to promote their work.
                             However this is not ideal because not everyone uses the same social 
                             media platforms. They need a webpage to direct clients to so that everyone 
                             will be able to see their work.  
                             The overall goal is to be able to promote their business to everyone 
                             and display their work to the public. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The client needs a domain on the internet to showcase their body of work to potential clients.</p>
                         <p>  There will also need to be a place on the site that will allow people to contact them.
                        </p>
                        <p>  The website should have links to their social media.

                        Sketches and lo-fi wireframes were created to explore possibilities 
                        for the layout of the site. I will keep in mind what the client needs their users
                         to get from the website Users need to be able to view their work and contact 
                         them through 
                         the website. Another important
                           detail to add to the website will be links to their social media 
                           sites so people can get to their businesses

                        <h1>Solution</h1>
                        <p>If you recall, in the beginning of our project we were given the problem of 
                            a client wanting to be able to reach out to more customers and clients. 
                            They needed to be able to expand their business and have a gallery to 
                            show their work online. I designed a functional UI to give their work 
                            and their business a home on the internet and allow them to grow past 
                            solely using social media platforms to showcase their work. This will 
                            allow the client to get more people's attention as well as having a 
                            more professional feel to their work and business.

                            <h1>logo design and color scheme</h1>
                            <p>After deciding on the layout of the webpage I want to pick a color scheme that
                                can be used for the website. I choose to go with a handful of neutral colors that
                                could be used for the site. I also to some time to experiment with some possible 
                                logo designs if my client would like to use them.
                            </p>

                            <p>I later created the final UI for the website using the images, text and color chooses.
                               I planned the image gallery layout with the images as seen in the final UI before hand.
                               I wanted the gallery page design to look seemless and the images to all be diffrent sizes.
                               this is what thet final layout of the webaite will look like. the last step now is to prototype
                               the artboards in a prototyping software, in this case I will be using Abode XD.
